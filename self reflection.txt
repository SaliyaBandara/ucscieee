I chose Madhack as the event to develop this web page. Since it is a highly technical competition, I decided the web page needs to include some flashy techy patterns and neon lights and texts, etc., to bring a high-tech feel.
I referenced https://madhack.ucscieee.com/ for the inspiration and content of the web page. I added my own twist to the Madhack theme and enhanced the feel. I also added some cool animations to the web page. Some of these animations might consume a lot of CPU power. It's not an encouraged feature of a website. But since this web page is an info page, I think it is not a problem. Also, most of the modern devices can easily handle it.

Designing a web page for a competition is entirely different from designing a normal consumer web page. This website should impress and be memorable to the potential participants. So it should be designed to be a fun and exciting experience for the participants and increase the time spent on the website. So, I gained a lot of knowledge about web page design and how to make a web page that is fun and exciting.

I was stuck with some UI bugs in the timeline section. Firefox rendered the timeline weirdly. So I had to fix it.

I am very familiar with frameworks such as Bootstrap and tailwindcss. But I decided to use Vanilla CSS for this project to be more flexible and show my familiarity with CSS.

Thank You,
